        I have always had a great interest in games and designing puzzles, ever since I had classmates lining up to play my "pen and paper" games in elementary school or when I ran Dungeons and Dragons for friends and family.

		While studying at Simon Fraser University, I focused my efforts on courses that broke down Game Design, Immersive Environments, Animation, Design Interactions, Sound design, and Graphic Design. These workshops helped me to better understand the nuances in game mechanics, how sound and music affects the user and environment, and how to create a better feedback loop so the user feels accomplished and rewarded when completing milestones.

  My goal is to create games like **Destiny**, **Bloodborne**, and **Remnant** that pose difficult challenges to the player and reward them for skill, while also focussing on environmental storytelling and puzzles that encourage collaboration and discussion.

### About Me

I am a graduate from **Simon Fraser University** with a **Bachelor's Degree in Arts and Social Sciences** from the faculty of **Interactive Arts and Technology**. My main focus of study was in **Game Design**, **Animation**, and **Modeling**, and was able to find way to implement at least one of these aspects into many of my projects throughout my degree.

​I'm an avid learner and am able to **pick up new skills quickly**. I enjoy challenges and love being able to flex my creative side by **designing map layouts**, **the flow of a level**, **combat encounters**, and **puzzles**. I'm familiar with leading and coordinating groups through design processes and taking an idea from concept to completion. 

I have experience in leading groups and firmly believe in the ideology of **"lead by example"**. I encourage collaboration and always try to make sure that the people I'm helping or in charge of are healthy, happy, and are able to **do their work without any obstructions**. I've taken several online courses designed to train people as Scrum Masters and have obtained the **IBM IT Scrum Master Certification**. In this specialization, I focussed on learning Agile methodologies and different methods on implementing them through work pipelines such as kanban boards. I am currently working on obtaining the **Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate** that focusses on a variety of tools in Unreal Engine and allows me to get a better handle on the various design methods in the engine.. 

My inspiration for pursuing **animation** mainly comes from **Monty Oum**, who directed the 3D anime **RWBY** and was also in charge of the Halo inspired **“Red vs Blue”** fight scenes until 2015 where he passed away. He had an incredibly unique animation style that was primarily focused on **over-the-top combat**. He was able to create very complex and visually breathtaking animations and started a trend of animations using that style.
