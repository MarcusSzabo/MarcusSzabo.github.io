## Mouse Trap

**Mouse Trap** was the final project from my **BUS 238 Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Innovation** class. The idea was to create a product that acted as a **mobile mouse attachemtent** that moved with the mouse while in use. This **support** and **mobilization** of the wrist would reduce the chance of **wrist damage** and lower the risk of **Carpal Tunnel**. This product design and presentation won multiple **awards** at **Opportunity Fest 2022** in the Lifestyle category. 

### The Process

The group I worked alongside was a fantastic team as everyone was already excited and invested in the project idea. We were able to create a basic idea very quickly and immediately began **research** on different **iterations** and materials that could be used to create an effective product. We researched the **main causes** of wrist damage that can occur from prolonged computer use as well as some of the main remedies typically used to **reduce the risk** of further damage as well as preventative measures. This lead us to coming up with a design that is able to "latch" onto most kinds of mouse designs and move just as effectively as the mouse while performing its main role of **wrist support**.
