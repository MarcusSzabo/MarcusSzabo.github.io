## Artificial Intelligence Avatar

An **Avatar** created using Autodesk Character Generator for a **Directed Studies** at Simon Fraser University where I designed a human avatar for an AI assistance. Alongside the avatar, I worked in a team to design a variety of animations in Maya for when the AI listens, thinks, and responds to the user. The avatar runs using Unity.

### The Process

I was invited to the Directed Studies by **Professor Steve Dipaola** and **PHD candidate Servet Ulas** to join their group for two semesters to assist with their project. 
In the first semester, I used my skills in **Maya** to create animations for the Avatar. In the second semester I led the next group, helped **organize the tasks and divvy out the work**. I also assisted with creating more animations and create the Avatar above.
