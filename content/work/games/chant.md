## The Chant

A psychedelic survival horror game that focuses on a ritual gone wrong during a spiritual retreat. Published by **Prime Matter** and developed **Brass Token**. My role on this project was working as a **Game Designer**.

### My Work

While a part of this project, I had a hand in a lot of different aspects of the game and had many jobs I was given lead on.
