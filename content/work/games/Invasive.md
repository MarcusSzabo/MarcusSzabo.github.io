## Invasive

**Invasive** is the final project in the **IAT 410 Advanced Game Design** class. The final project was designed using **Unreal Engine** and all of the assets and character/enemy models in the game was designed using **Maya**. Invasive was designed as a **Horror Puzzle** game where the player must explore a space station that has been overrun by sentient plant life that is attempting to hamper or kill the player.


### The Work

During this project I was the acting **project manager**, assisted in **game design**, and was the main **artist** on the project in terms of **3D modeling**. I designed the characters, enemies and boss in the game as well as designing the assets. I created **animations** for the character's, enemy's, and boss's **"Idle" and "Active"** states. I also created basic **puzzles** for the game that requires manipulation of the environment, enemies, and throwable objects in order to solve the puzzles and progress.

While we were creating the game, we wanted to take a **different approach** with a typical horror game. In most games, the player wants to avoid the enemies as much as possible. However, in this experience we created enemies that were **integral to the player's survival**. As the player had a limited amount of oxygen at their disposal, they had to remain relatively close to certain enemies or objects in the world while they explored. The player was also able to interact with the environment by throwing certain objects to distract enemies and sneak by them as needed.

As a part of wanting to flex my capabilities in **Maya and Animating**, I wanted to help create an environment that held the aesthetic of the world, while also creating an engaging world the player can explore. I built out nearly every asset in the game including enemies, the player, objects, and the boss enemy, as well as creating the appropriate animations for them.

As the organizer and team lead for the project, I created schedules and guidelines for us to keep to as well as setting up a shared workspace for everyone to show their work and collaborate in.
