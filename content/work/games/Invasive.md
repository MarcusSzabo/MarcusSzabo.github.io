## Invasive

**Invasive** is the final project in the **IAT 410 Advanced Game Design** class. The final project was designed using **Unreal Engine** and all of the assets and character/enemy models in the game was designed using **Maya**.


### The Process

During this project I was acting **project manager**, assisted in **game design**, and was the main **artist** on the project in terms of **3D modeling**. I designed the characters, enemies and boss in the game as well as designing the assets. I created **animations** for the character's, enemy's, and boss's **"Idle" and "Active"** states. I also created basic **puzzles** for the game that requires manipulation of the environment, enemies, and throwable objects in order to solve the puzzles and progress.
