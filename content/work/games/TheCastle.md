## The Castle

**The Castle** is an **interactive soundscape** based **VR** game where the user must use the environment to create unique sounds in order to solve **puzzles**. This was the final project for our **IAT 340 Sound Design** course based in **Unity** and the audio was connected using **MAX MSP**. The Castle places the character in a locked castle, and must create specific sounds using objects around the level, with each object and environment piece having a **unique combination** of noises depending on the object hitting and the object being hit.

### The Process

In this project, I took charge of **Project Management** to help guide the group, keep everyone on track, and make sure that we were making reasonable and feasible design decisions. I designed the **level, layout,** and set up the **VR** structure. This project was a unique **challenge** as it took a new software and allowed us to find unique ways to connect it to the Unity base.
